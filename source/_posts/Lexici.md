Lexici is a collection of problems implemented in a variety of different languages. The problems are sourced form [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Using this data set of programming languages constructed using the same algorithm for the same problems allows for interesting comparisons between the different languages.

This can be used as a reference to compare implementation of the same algorithm across a number of different programming languages, allowing for better understanding of a new language.

Using the timed results of the executable, and the bytes of code required to achieve equivalent algorithms, we assign an efficiency metric. This is a rough approximation of the lines of code required related to the execution speed of that language.

It is note worthy that each language is suitable for different tasks, and thus a language may be extremely well suited for one problem, but may require much more work and time on other problems. This is merely a general comparison of how each language fairs against a variety of problems.

## Problems ##

The currently implemented problems from project Euler are problems one through ten.

## Languages ##
